                    <h3>GARLIC BREAD WITHOUT BASE</h3>
                    <h5>INGREDIENTS</h5>
                    <p>8 slices or a loaf of bread cut into 8 slices each of 0.75 inches. use any bread of your choice</p>
                        <p>2 tablespoons Butter – salted or unsalted</p>
                        <p>½ teaspoon garlic – minced or grated or 3 to 4 small to medium-sized garlic cloves, peeled and minced</p>
                        <p>salt as required, to be added if using unsalted butter</p>
                        <p>red chili flakes as required</p>
                        <p>dry oregano as required or add your favorite herbs</p>
                        <p>black pepper as required, optional</p>
                        <h5>METHOD</h5>
                        <h6>Preparation</h6>
                        <p>1. Take the bread slices and cut each slice into equal halves or triangles.</p>
                        <p>2. In a small mixing bowl take the softened salted butter and minced garlic.  If using unsalted butter add a few pinches of salt to it.</p>
                        <p>3. Cook it again for 2-3 mins until the dough comes together and forms a film on the bottom of the pan</p>
                        <p>4. Next evenly spread the garlic butter on the bread slices. You can be more generous with the butter if you prefer.</p>
                        <p>5. Pipe directly in the pan and fry for 3-4 mins or until golden brown</p>
                        <h6>Making Garlic Bread</h6>
                        <p>1. Heat a frying pan, flat skillet griddle on medium heat.</p>
                        <p>2. When the pan or skillet becomes hot, reduce the heat to a low or medium-low. Place the bread slices on the skillet.</p>
                        <p>3. Cover the bread slices with a lid.</p>
                        <p>4. Keeping the slices covered, roast till light golden and a bit toasted at the edges. </p>
                        <p>5. If you want a more crisp toasted texture, then you can toast the bread slices for some more minutes.</p>
                        <p>6. Once the garlic bread has got lightly toasted from the edges, sprinkle your favorite herb or spice from top. I added red chili flakes and some dried oregano.</p>
                        <p>7. Serve Garlic Bread toast hot or warm.</p>
